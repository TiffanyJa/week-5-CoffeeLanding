            <h3>Tasting coffee</h3>
            <p>
                Taste is a matter of preference, but for novice drinkers, what are the things to look for when tasting a cup of black coffee or an espresso?  The main characteristics to look for across the board are sweetness, acidity, body, and cleanliness, and if there is a lingering aftertaste, of course, you want it to be pleasant. If it's a cup of brewed black coffee, look for that sweetness you get from brown sugar, the acidity you'll find in lemon, raspberry, or blueberry. Also feel how the coffee weighs on the tongue. Is it closer to whole milk or 2 percent? Maybe it is light-bodied, near indistinguishable from a strong cup of Earl Grey Tea. For espresso, make sure it's not sharp or salty. You want it to be equal parts syrupy, fluffy with a slight intensity tempered by a mild sweetness. It might even be pleasantly effervescent.
